jsTab
=====
This is my first js project. I have learnt a lot and still have more to go through.

Simple js + jQuery + underscore table with pagination, filtering, sorting and data placed in virtual backend which pretends to have a setback in providing data.

Please note that is not perfectly written. I have started using jQuery after a while, that is why some of js commands should be replaced with jQuery ones. Underscore is mainly used to manage arrays in an easy way.
